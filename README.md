# Safe_Reinforcement_Learning_for_Human_Robot_Shared_Control
Implemented Safe Reinforcement Learning for humanâ€“robot shared control, optimizing robot assistance (e.g., exoskeletons, wheelchairs) under strict safety constraints. Applied Constrained Policy Optimization and Lagrangian methods to balance performance with guaranteed safety.
